Description: For a given metabolic network, this package finds the gaps (metabolites not produced or not consumed in any other reaction), and fills it from the stoichiometric reactions of a reference metabolic reconstruction using a weighting function. Also the option to download all the set of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism from the KEGG database <http://www.genome.jp/kegg/> is available.
